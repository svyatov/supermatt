# Ask SuperMatt

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

Skills are named here as `/name`. In Codex, type `$name` instead. From the Claude Code plugin, type `/supermatt:name`: a bare `/code-review` runs Claude Code's bundled review, not this one.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and two **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is standalone, or a vocabulary layer that runs underneath.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens the idea by interview. Start here whenever you are **working in a working directory**: it's stateful, retaining what it learns in `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs. (No working directory? Use `/grill-me` instead, covered under Standalone. Both run the same `/grilling` primitive; `grill-with-docs` is the one that leaves a paper trail, which makes it the better of the two whenever a repo is there to leave it in.)
2. **Branch: can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype, bridged by **`/handoff`** in both directions (the prototype is a side task forked mid-phase, one of the narrow cases `/handoff` is for; see Phase boundaries):
   - **`/handoff`** out, then open a fresh session against that file,
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - **`/handoff`** back what you learned, and reference it from the original idea thread.
3. **Branch: is this a multi-session build?**
   - **Yes** → **`/to-spec`** (turn the thread into a spec), then **`/to-tickets`** to split it into tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its **blocking edges**. On a local tracker that's one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature>/issues/`, worked blockers-first by hand; on a real tracker the edges become native blocking links, so any ticket whose blockers are done can be grabbed: kick off **`/implement`** per ticket, **`/clear`ing context between each one**. Each ticket is self-contained, so the last one's context is disposable.
   - **No** → **`/implement`** right here, in the same context window.

   Either way, **`/implement`** builds each issue by driving **`/tdd`** internally (one red-green slice at a time), then commits, runs **`/qa`** in a fresh subagent (drives the running program the way its user would, a terminal program in tmux or a web app in a browser, and checks every requested behavior), and closes out by running **`/code-review`**, a three-axis review (Standards, Spec, Adversarial) of the diff. When the work goes up as a pull request, **`/pr`** shapes the body: a summary diagram, before/after evidence, and the merge danger. Reach for **`/tdd`** on its own when you just want to build a concrete behaviour test-first without a full spec, **`/qa`** on its own whenever you want to see a branch actually work before anyone reads its code, and **`/code-review`** on its own whenever you want to review a branch or PR against a fixed point.

4. **Ship.** **`/fix-findings`** applies the findings of the last review or check (a finding's text works too, from another session). **`/refactor the changes on this branch since origin/main`** cleans up what the branch added without changing behavior, and stops when the code is already clean. **`/ship-pr`** commits, pushes, opens the pull request, waits for green CI, and squash merges; **`/commit`** commits on the current branch when you are not ready to ship. Then **`/retro`** on the session, so the next one starts from what this one learned.

### Unattended: `/orchestrate`

When the issues are triaged and you want the queue worked without you, **`/orchestrate`** runs the main flow per issue, from inside a herdr pane in Claude Code. `/orchestrate 3` works three issues in parallel, each in its own pane and git worktree, and a branch that conflicts with one merged before it goes through `/resolving-merge-conflicts`. It opens a worker session in the lane's pane for each phase: `/triage` for an untriaged bug, `/implement`, `/fix-findings` for what the review left, `/refactor` and `/ship-pr`, then `/retro` and a merged lessons PR. It answers the workers' questions and dialogs itself (through `/what-would-you-do`), verifies each spec once its tickets close, and notifies you only when the queue is done or it needs you.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1-3 in **one unbroken context window** (don't compact or clear until after `/to-tickets`) so the grilling, spec, and tickets all build on the same thinking. Each `/implement` then starts fresh, working from the ticket.

The limit on this is the **[smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone)**: the window (~150k tokens) within which the model still reasons sharply. If a session approaches it before `/to-tickets`, don't push on degraded; `/compact` at the nearest phase boundary and carry on (see Phase boundaries).

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **No idea yet, and you want candidates** → **`/ideate`**. It grounds itself in the repo, generates ideas through six frames, has a fresh subagent try to refute each one, and writes the ranked **survivors** to `docs/ideation/`. Each survivor carries a prompt that takes it into **`/grill-with-docs`** in a fresh session, where the main flow starts. It finds *what* to build; `/grill-with-docs` shapes the one you pick.

- **Bugs and requests piling up** → **`/triage`**. It moves issues through triage roles and produces agent-ready issues, which **`/implement`** later picks up.

  Triage is only for issues **you didn't create**: bug reports, incoming feature requests, anything that arrives raw. Specs and tickets that `/to-spec` and `/to-tickets` produced are already agent-ready, so **don't triage them**; `/triage` leaves them out of its queue.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** (one command that already goes red on *this* bug), then fixes with a regression test, checks the reported symptom is gone in the running program with **`/qa`**, and reviews the fix with **`/code-review`**.

- **A huge, foggy effort: a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time, producing **decisions, not deliverables**, until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't, and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: merge onto the main flow at **`/to-spec`**, which collapses the map's linked decisions into a buildable plan, then `/to-tickets` and `/implement` as usual. Looping the map straight into `/implement` skips that collapse and throws the linked detail away, so go straight to `/implement` only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

## Codebase health

Not feature work, just upkeep.

- **`/retro`** looks back at a finished session (this one by default) and suggests changes to the agent's **environment**: automated checks, context pointers, coding-standards rules, stale or contradictory instructions, a leaner `AGENTS.md`. Run it after a session that went badly, so the next one doesn't repeat the mistake.

- **`/improve-architecture`** runs whenever you have a spare moment to keep the codebase good for agents to operate in. When the architecture is healthy, it says so and stops. Otherwise it maps the structure, lists **deepening opportunities**, grills you on the one you pick, designs its interface, and writes a plan that merges onto the main flow at step 3 (`/to-spec`, or `/implement` for a small change). It's the survey that finds the candidates; **`/codebase-design`** (below) is the bench you design the chosen one on. (`/architecture-review` is its deprecated former name.)
- **`/refactor`** is the code-level counterpart: complexity, duplication, naming, and dead code inside modules whose boundaries are fine. It assesses first and stops when the code is clean, and it refuses to change code no test covers until you decide.
- **`/improve-tests`** cuts a slow or bloated test suite to the tests that catch real bugs: it times the suite first, deletes or demotes the tests that catch nothing, fixes slow setup, and proves each cut keeps the checks that matter.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills, each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`**: sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grill-with-docs` drives to keep `GLOSSARY.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** is the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` and `/improve-architecture` both speak it.

## Phase boundaries

A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session: the grilling, the implementation, the QA. At the **boundary** between two of them you have five options, and picking between them is the fuzziest decision in this whole map:

- **Continue**: stay put. Costs nothing, loses nothing.
- **`/clear`**: empty the window, when nothing here matters to what's next.
- **`/handoff`** writes a portable markdown file. Narrow: only for a **new harness**, a **new directory**, a **colleague**, or forking a side task **mid-phase**. What it buys is portability.
- **Subagent**: send a tightly-scoped task to its own window and get a report back.
- **`/compact`** replaces this context with a summary and continues the same conversation. The **default**, at the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach.

Read [PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md](PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md) for the ordered tree: the five questions, the reasoning behind each branch, and why the primary-source cost makes **Continue** the one to rule out first. Make the decision **at** a boundary; mid-phase, continue, split the rest into subagents, or fork a side task with `/handoff`.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/grill-me`**: the same relentless interview as `/grill-with-docs`, but **stateless**: it saves nothing locally and builds no `GLOSSARY.md`. Reach for it when you are **not working in a working directory** (sharpening a plan, a design, a piece of writing, anything with no repo under it). If you are in a working directory, use `/grill-with-docs` instead: it runs the same interview and leaves a paper trail, so it is strictly the better one.
- **`/grilling`** is the interview primitive itself: rounds, the frontier, facts are the agent's job and decisions are yours. `/grill-me` and `/grill-with-docs` are the two named ways in, and `/triage`, `/wayfinder` and `/improve-architecture` all run it internally. Reach for it directly only when you want the interview with no wrapper around it.
- **`/resolving-merge-conflicts`** works an in-progress merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by **intent** traced to each side's primary source rather than by picking lines, then finishes the operation. It never runs `--abort`. Standalone and off every flow: reach for it when you are already mid-conflict.
- **`/prototype`** is a small, throwaway program that answers one design question: does this state model feel right, or what should this UI look like. Throwaway is a constraint on how the code is written, not a promise to destroy it: the answer folds into the real code, and the prototype itself is kept as a **primary source** on a `prototype/<name>` branch out of main, pointed at from the issue that asked the question (or the handoff, before an issue exists). It's the detour in step 2 of the main flow, but reach for it any time a design question is hard to settle on paper.
- **`/research`**: delegate reading legwork to a **background agent**: it investigates a question against **primary sources**, then leaves a cited Markdown file in the repo. Keep working while it reads. The file it produces is something to take *into* the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`, since research feeds the thinking rather than replacing it.
- **`/to-questionnaire`** comes in when the thing blocking you isn't in your head or the codebase but in **someone else's**, and it writes them a questionnaire to fill in. It's the inverse of `/grill-me`: instead of interviewing you about the subject, it interviews you about the **send** (who it's going to, what you need back) and aims the questions at the gap. What comes back is material for `/grill-with-docs`.
- **`/wait-what`** is the corrective for a message that didn't land. Use it mid-conversation, inside any other skill, and the agent re-pitches what it just said with the context you were missing, in plain English, using the `GLOSSARY.md` vocabulary. It works after the fact; `/grill-with-docs` is the upfront cure, because a shared language agreed early is what stops the jargon arriving at all.
- **`/what-would-you-do`** is the answer to a question the agent asked you that you can't answer yet: it explains the problem, weighs each option, and recommends one. When the options stay close and a wrong pick is costly, it offers a ready-to-run **`/jury`** line.
- **`/jury`** puts a hard decision to a panel of 3 or 5 subagents (one on `codex` when installed): blind votes, one anonymous review round, and one committed verdict with the dissent and a first action.
- **`/dependency-vetting`** checks that a package is authentic before anything installs, adds, or recommends it. The model reaches for it by itself whenever a task adds a dependency.
- **`/teach`**: learn a concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful workspace.
- **`/writing-for-agents`** is the reference for writing documents agents consume: skills, AGENTS.md, pointed-at docs.

## Precondition

**`/setup-supermatt-skills`**: run before your first engineering flow to configure the issue tracker, triage labels, and doc layout the other skills assume. Custom issue trackers also work.
