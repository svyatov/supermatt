#!/bin/sh
# Usage: mutate.sh [-b BUILD] [-t SECONDS] TEST MUTATION...
#
# Applies each mutation on its own, runs BUILD (when given) and then TEST, and
# restores the file before the next one. A mutation file holds the target path
# on its first line, then the exact text to find, a line holding only ====, and
# the text to put in its place. Only the first match is replaced.
#
# Prints one line per mutation file: red (TEST failed), GREEN (TEST passed: no
# test protects that behavior), timeout (TEST ran past SECONDS and was killed),
# broken (BUILD failed, which proves nothing), or missing (the text to find is
# not in the file). SECONDS defaults to five times the unchanged run plus a
# minute. Exits 1 unless every mutation is red. Exits 2 before any mutation
# when BUILD or TEST already fails on the unchanged code, since every mutation
# would then read red. After a broken mutation, a hint on stderr names its
# usual cause, an unused name.
#
# TEST runs under a perl supervisor that leads a process group of its own, so
# dash, which has no job control without a terminal, gets one too. The group
# is killed whole once TEST exits. A process whose parent died, as a test
# runner's child does when the runner is killed on its own timeout, stays in
# the group, so nothing TEST started outlives it.
