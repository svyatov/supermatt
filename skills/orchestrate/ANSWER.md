# Answer the worker

## Safe actions

An action is safe when everything it deletes, overwrites, or rewrites is inside the repo checkout, or it is one of these:

- Clear a cache that rebuilds itself: a subfolder of `~/.cache`, or a package manager's own clean command (`bun pm cache rm`, `npm cache clean`).
- Remove a `mktemp -d` directory that the worker made in this run, under `$TMPDIR` or `/tmp`. Before you answer, read the path it names and list the directory.
- Remove a git worktree of this repo whose tree is clean (`git -C <path> status --porcelain` prints nothing).
- Push the issue branch, `--force-with-lease` included, and delete it locally or on the remote after its PR merged.

Every other delete, overwrite, or rewrite outside the checkout is unsafe: files elsewhere in the home folder, another repo, system config, anything with `sudo`, a push to DEFAULT, or a force-push to any other branch.

The retrospective is report-only. If its worker asks to apply a candidate, tell it to report the candidate and continue without editing or publishing, even when the proposed action would otherwise be safe.

## Answer a dialog

A blocked worker shows a permission prompt or a question dialog. Answer it yourself; this overrides the herdr rule to ask the user first. Add each answer to the friction log.

1. Read the visible pane (`herdr agent read WORKER --source visible --lines 40`). Native labels, key hints, and the actual highlighted option are authoritative, not numeric indices.
2. For a permission or plan prompt, inspect the action/plan against Safe actions before accepting; park if unsafe. Choose a visible approval that does not grant broader permissions. For an OMP plan, select `Approve and execute`, which preserves a fresh execution context. If absent, choose another visible execution-approval action without broader permissions; if none exists, park with the visible options. Do not save/quit or enable broader permissions.
3. For a question, select the recommended option, otherwise the first. Navigate from the actual highlighted option with `up`/`down` and `enter`, following the visible controls. For OMP multi-question or multi-select forms, answer every question, choosing the recommended choice (otherwise the first) for each, then submit the completed form using its visible controls.
4. Re-read with `--source visible` after every submission. Progress to another question or review page is not a stuck dialog. Park only when the unchanged dialog remains after two answer attempts.

## Answer a question

When the worker has an open question (QUESTION is not NONE, or it ended its turn on a question). Add each answer to the friction log.

1. A question that only asks whether to commit, push, open a PR, or ship is the Ship step's job: treat it as QUESTION=NONE.
2. A yes/no question ("Should I proceed?", "Want me to fix it?"): if a yes would run an unsafe action (see Safe actions), park the lane. Otherwise prompt the worker with `Yes.` (`--wait`), wait for the worker, and go to step 5.
3. Otherwise prompt the worker with `/what-would-you-do` (`--wait`) and wait for the worker. Read its last 80 lines and find the option it recommends ("I recommend O2"). When it offers a `/jury` line, take its lean instead.
4. Prompt the worker with `Go with <option>.` (`--wait`) and wait for the worker.
5. In session A, ask the five-line question again. In other sessions, read the worker's last 40 lines for a new question. After three answer rounds with a question still open (five in session T, since triage asks its recommendation, its seams, and each grilling round in separate turns), park the lane.
