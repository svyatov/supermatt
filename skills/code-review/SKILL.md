---

Three-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?
- **Adversarial**: how does the change fail in production?

Every axis has **two readers**, run in parallel so they don't pollute each other's context: a sub-agent of the host model and the **peer**, the other model family's CLI. A model favours its own reasoning and its errors correlate with its own family's, so sub-agents of one model agreeing is one reading repeated, and a second family catches bugs the first reads past. For the same reason, the family that did not raise a finding validates it, and this skill aggregates what survives.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing, tell the user to run `/setup-supermatt-skills` (`$setup-supermatt-skills` in Codex).

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If they didn't specify one and HEAD is on a branch other than the default branch, the fixed point is the default branch (`git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, minus its `origin/`): name it in one line and carry on. On the default branch with uncommitted changes, the fixed point is `HEAD`: name it in one line and carry on. On a clean default branch, ask.

Resolve the merge-base once with `git merge-base <fixed-point> HEAD`, create a fresh `mktemp -d` directory (`$DIR` below), and write the diff into it: `git diff <merge-base-sha> > "$DIR/diff.patch"` (against the merge-base, and including uncommitted changes to tracked files), then append every untracked file: `git ls-files -z --others --exclude-standard | xargs -0 -I{} git diff --no-index /dev/null {} >> "$DIR/diff.patch"` (it exits non-zero whenever it appends a file, which is expected). That file is the diff every reader reads: a shell hook can shorten a diff printed to the terminal, and a redirected one lands on disk whole. Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside six parallel readers.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, a local issue file path, etc.), fetched via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument. When it lies outside the repository, copy it to `$DIR/spec.md`, since the `claude` peer cannot read outside the repository.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. The request, plan, or approved findings in this conversation that the change carries out: write them to `$DIR/spec.md` and name that as the spec.
5. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** axis will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md): a Fowler smell baseline, a refactor check, and a test check. A documented repo standard overrides the baseline.

### 4. Pick the peer

The peer is the other model's CLI:

- `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION=1` is set: the host is `claude`, so the peer is `codex`. (`CLAUDECODE` is not enough: IDE extensions set it in their terminals too.)
- Any of `CODEX_SANDBOX`, `CODEX_SESSION_ID`, or `CODEX_THREAD_ID` is set: the host is `codex`, so the peer is `claude`.

Confirm the peer is installed with `command -v <peer>`. When the host is unknown, the peer is missing, or the peer already failed in this session on a usage limit whose reset time has not passed, there is **no peer**: every axis runs with its host reader only and validation stays on the host model. Note the reason for the report.

Before the peer starts, tell the user one line: "Peer review: sending the diff to <peer> for every axis." This is a notice, so carry on without waiting for a reply.

### 5. Run both readers of every axis in parallel

Each axis has one prompt, and both of its readers get that same text. Every axis prompt includes the **finding rules** (see _Finding rules_) pasted in full.

**Standards prompt** should include:

- The diff file path and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the contents of [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md)** (smell baseline, refactor check, test check) pasted in full (the readers have no other access to them).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk; (c) any refactor check hit: name the commit and the test file; and (d) any test check hit: quote the untested behavior or the vacuous assertion. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, refactor check hits are hard, but baseline smells and test check hits are judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Under 400 words."

**Spec prompt** should include:

- The diff file path and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec axis and note this in the final report.

**Adversarial prompt** is the contents of [ADVERSARIAL.md](ADVERSARIAL.md), then the finding rules, then the diff file path and commit list, then the test command this session ran and its result (the peer runs read-only and often cannot build), then, when the repo builds a program, the path of one built from `HEAD` so a reader can run a trigger instead of only tracing it, then "Under 400 words."

Build that program in `$DIR` with the repo's own build command (a build binary already in the checkout may predate the change). The peer cannot write anywhere, so it can only run a trigger whose state already exists: create any fixture, config, or first-run setup the program needs under `$DIR` now, and name it in the Adversarial prompt. Write each axis prompt, with every path in it absolute, to `$DIR/<axis>.prompt.md` (`standards`, `spec`, `adversarial`), and write each fixture's contents the same way, with the file-writing tool (Claude Code: Write), keeping the shell for `mkdir`, `git`, and `ln`.

Save the state of the working tree with `git status --short > "$DIR/tree.before"` and `git diff HEAD >> "$DIR/tree.before"`, then start every reader at once:

- **Host reader**: a sub-agent whose prompt is this text, word for word on every axis, with `$DIR`, `<axis>`, and `<repo>` filled in: "Read `$DIR/<axis>.prompt.md` in full and follow it, since that file holds the whole prompt. Return your report as your final text. Work only in `$DIR/<axis>.scratch/`: to run a trigger or a mutation, first copy the tree there with `rsync -a --exclude .git <repo>/ $DIR/<axis>.scratch/`, then edit and run the copy. Write file contents with the file-writing tool, and keep the shell for `mkdir`, `git`, `ln`, and `rsync`." The copy is the whole tree, since a build reads files the diff never names, such as an embed or a fixture. The repository and the prepared fixtures stay as they are, since the peer reads them at the same time. Step 8 deletes the scratch directories with `$DIR`.
- **Peer reader**: the peer's command on that prompt file, run from the repo root as its own background shell call per axis (Claude Code: `run_in_background: true`, with no trailing `&`), so the call's completion notice is the signal that its output is ready:
  - `codex`: `codex exec - --ignore-user-config --disable apps --disable plugins -C "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" -s read-only -c 'approval_policy="never"' -c 'model_reasoning_effort="high"' --ephemeral -o "$DIR/<axis>.peer.md" < "$DIR/<axis>.prompt.md" > "$DIR/<axis>.peer.log" 2>&1`. Its progress log runs to hundreds of kilobytes, so it goes to the `.log` file, where a failed run's error is read.
  - `claude`: it has no shell, so first build its input `$DIR/<axis>.peer-in.md`: the prompt file, then each `$DIR` text file the prompt names (the diff, `spec.md` when the spec lives there, text fixtures; never the built program, which this peer cannot run), each between `=== BEGIN <file> <nonce> ===` and `=== END <file> <nonce> ===` lines, where `<nonce>` is one `openssl rand -hex 8` value, so a diff cannot close its own block and pose as instructions. Then run `claude -p --safe-mode --strict-mcp-config --tools Read Grep Glob --permission-mode dontAsk --effort high --no-session-persistence < "$DIR/<axis>.peer-in.md" > "$DIR/<axis>.peer.md"`. When the Codex sandbox blocks its network access, request escalated permissions for this command.

Each flag set keeps the peer read-only, with no MCP servers, plugins, or approval escalation, so it cannot write through the user's own config. The `codex` flags also skip the user's `config.toml`, so that peer runs on the CLI's default model; `claude --safe-mode` keeps the user's model selection. Both run at high reasoning effort.

Wait for every reader before step 6. With nothing else to do while they run, wait in short calls (`sleep 20`), so each completion notice lands between them: one long sleep holds the notice until the sleep ends. When a peer run exits non-zero, leaves its output empty, says it could not read or review the diff, or has not finished 15 minutes after it started, stop it: its axis keeps the host reader only, and the report notes the reason. A usage-limit failure stops the other peer runs too, since they share the limit. An axis is **incomplete** when neither of its readers finished it.

Once every reader is done, write the same two outputs to `$DIR/tree.after` and run `cmp "$DIR/tree.before" "$DIR/tree.after"`. A difference means a reader edited the repository while the others read it: stop, and tell the user which files changed, since every reader's view of them is suspect.

### 6. Merge the readers of each axis

Within one axis, two findings that name the same defect at the same `file:line` (or the same missing requirement) become one finding tagged `[both]`, with the clearer wording and the higher severity. Tag every other finding with the reader that raised it: `[<host>]` or `[<peer>]`, such as `[claude]` or `[codex]`. Merge only within an axis, never across axes.

### 7. Validate across families

A `[both]` finding whose two readers gave the same severity is already confirmed: two model families found it independently. Number every other quoted P0, P1, and P2 finding, including a `[both]` finding whose readers disagreed on severity, since they agreed that it exists but not how much it matters; the peer validates it. When there are none, skip to step 8. Otherwise give each finding to the family that did not raise it, both validators at once:

- **Peer findings**: one host validator sub-agent.
- **Host findings**: the peer. Write `$DIR/validate.prompt.md` and run the step 5 peer command on it, writing `$DIR/validate.peer.md`. When there is no peer, the host validator sub-agent takes these findings too, and the report notes that they were validated by the same model. When the peer run fails as in step 5, these findings are `not validated`.

Each validator prompt is the contents of [VALIDATOR.md](VALIDATOR.md), then its numbered findings with their axis, quote, and reasoning, then the diff file path and commit list.

Apply the verdicts to each finding on its own axis:

- **confirmed**: the finding stays as written, keeping the validator's "incidence not measured" note when it gave one.
- **rejected**: check the evidence the rejection cites: open its `file:line`, or read the test result it reports. When it shows what the validator claims, the finding leaves its axis and goes on that axis's "Dropped by verification" line with the validator's reason. When it does not, the finding stays, labelled `unresolved: rejection not confirmed`.
- **unresolved**: the finding stays with its severity, labelled `unresolved: <evidence still needed>`.

When a validator fails or leaves a finding without a verdict, that finding stays and is labelled `not validated`.

### 8. Aggregate

Delete `$DIR` first: nothing from here on reads it.

Present the merged findings under `## Standards`, `## Spec`, and `## Adversarial` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned, keeping each finding's reader tag, severity, `file:line`, and quoted line. Open each heading with one coverage line naming the readers that finished it and the reason any did not (`Readers: claude, codex` or `Readers: claude (codex: usage limit)`), and end it with its "Dropped by verification" line when step 7 dropped anything. Do **not** merge or rerank findings across axes, because the axes are deliberately separate (see _Why separate axes_). Print this aggregate as its own message before anything else continues, also when another skill loaded this one. Done when every finding from every axis appears under its heading or on its dropped line.

A **verified** finding quotes its line and was not rejected in step 7. Step 7 checks only P0 to P2, so a P3 that quotes its line is verified, and it stays open until it is fixed. End with a one-line summary: findings per axis by severity, then the verdict:

- Any verified P0 on any axis: **Not ready**.
- Otherwise, any verified P1 or an incomplete axis: **Ready with fixes**.
- Otherwise: **Ready**.

The verdict is a rule over severities. Don't pick a single worst finding across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Finding rules

- **Severity.** Tag every finding:
  - **P0**: breaks production, loses data, or opens a security hole.
  - **P1**: wrong behavior in normal use.
  - **P2**: a real problem with limited reach.
  - **P3**: minor.

  Baseline smells are P2 or P3. A refactor check hit is P1. A test check hit is P2.

- **Quote the line.** Every finding cites `file:line` and quotes the line it flags. The line is the file's own line number, counted from the `+` side of its hunk header (`@@ -a,b +c,d @@` starts at line `c`), never a line of `diff.patch`. A claim that something is missing quotes where it would be defined, and a race quotes both sides. A claim that nothing else calls or uses a symbol rests on a symbol-aware search (LSP, CodeGraph) when one is available, and otherwise says "grep-only". Label a finding without a quote `unverified`; it does not move the verdict.
- **Run the equivalence.** When the diff changes what a selector, query, pattern, or condition matches and the spec asks for unchanged behavior, run the old and new forms on the same input (a fixture, a test, the built program) before you call them equivalent. An equivalence you did not run is a finding labelled `unverified`.
- **Read by range.** Read the diff file in full, by line range when it is long. A file the diff adds is already in it whole; read other files by line range for the context around a hunk.
- **Lead with the effect.** Open each finding with what a user or caller sees, then give one fix. When more than one fits, recommend one and name the trade-off. When the right fix depends on something you can't see, propose the most likely default and name the assumption.
- **Skip:**
  - Code the diff didn't change, unless the diff makes it newly relevant (a new caller of an existing bug). Test: would you flag it on the same diff without the surrounding file?
  - A problem a caller, guard, or framework default already handles. Check them before you flag it.
  - Anything a linter, formatter, or type checker enforces, and code under a lint-ignore comment for that rule.
  - "Consider adding X" or "might break under load" with no concrete failure the diff makes reachable.
  - Needs the spec doesn't have yet.
  - Choices the code or spec marks as intentional.
- **Zero findings is a valid report.** Say so in one line.

## Why separate axes

A change can pass one axis and fail another:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**
- Code that follows every standard and matches the spec but breaks on an input nobody listed → **Standards and Spec pass, Adversarial fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking another.
