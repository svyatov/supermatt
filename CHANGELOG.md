# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1]

### Changed

- Every skill declares `license: MIT` in its frontmatter, so a skill directory copied on its own keeps its license.
- Instructions to run a user-invoked skill also give the Codex form (`$name`), and `ask-matt` notes it once.
- `resolving-merge-conflicts`, `retro`, `triage` and `teach` hand their heavy reading to a sub-agent.
- `wizard` declares its bash requirement in `compatibility`, and its template no longer assumes a setup done in a browser.

### Fixed

- `implement` commits before it runs `code-review`, so the review sees the new work.
- `setup-supermatt-skills` lists external PRs through `gh api`, because `gh pr list` has no `authorAssociation` field, and it maps the `bug` and `enhancement` category labels too.
- `pr` keeps its credits in flat `metadata` keys, as the spec requires string values.
- `ask-matt` describes `/compact` as continuing the same conversation.
- `improve-codebase-architecture` and `to-questionnaire` examples now follow their own rules.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- `retro` (user-invoked): review a finished coding session and suggest changes to the agent's environment. Imported from mattpocock/skills.
- `pr` (model-invoked): the shape of a pull request body. Imported from mattpocock/skills, with the `show-me` MIT notice in its `CREDITS.md`.

### Fixed

- `ask-matt` no longer says the `diagnosing-bugs` post-mortem hands off to `improve-codebase-architecture`.
- `domain-modeling`: the `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` example now opens with a `# Glossary Map` heading.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Claude Code and Codex marketplaces for the plugin and its 25 engineering and productivity skills.
